# 🧠 Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! I'm **Siddharth Mehra**, currently transitioning into the world of data science and machine learning with a strong foundation in operations and analytics from Afterpay (Block Inc.).

This repository showcases a curated collection of beginner-to-intermediate projects that reflect my growing capabilities in Python, SQL, Tableau, data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.

## 💡 Why This Portfolio?

These projects are part of my personal learning journey as I apply data science to real-world problems. Each one is designed to reflect business use cases, structured code, and clean visuals.

📊 I've applied **SQL** to generate real business insights, and used **Tableau** to present executive-ready dashboards that simulate Afterpay-style customer/collections data.
